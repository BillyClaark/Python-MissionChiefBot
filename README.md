# Python Mission Chief Bot

A small bot for the game missionchief.com. Once you've provided it with a username and password in the account.txt file it will log in for you and run through the missions assigning vehicles. It will do so indefinitely. 

This will not work for anyone else as it stands, but it only takes a small tweek to the vehicle checkbox code. You'll have to change the find by id to the id of your vehicle checkboxes. 
This is something i'll be changing soon.
