# Python Mission Chief Bot

 **A small bot for the game missionchief written in Python, automatically reads the missions requirements and tries to despatch the required vehicles accordingly.**

**This bot only works with a vanilla / default account, so don't expect it to work with custom callsigns - Just yet.**


## How to use
Download the code, install Python then open up a cmd and type in the following:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`-

Once done open the account.txt and replace corresponding lines with your account information, and url.txt and enter the domain your account is registered such as `https://www.missionchief.co.uk/`

Once you're done, do the following in a cmd - it will run the bot for you.
`run missionchief_bot.py`
