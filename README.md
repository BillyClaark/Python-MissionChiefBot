# Python Mission Chief Bot
A small bot for the game missionchief.com. Once you've provided it with a username and password in the account.txt file it will log in for you and run through the missions assigning vehicles. It will do so indefinitely. 

To use:

`pip install splinter`-

Go and grab the latest chromedriver from:
'http://chromedriver.chromium.org/'

Put that in the same directory at the python script.

Open account.txt and replace corresponding lines with your account information

`run missionchief_bot.py`
