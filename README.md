A small bot for the game missionchief.com. Once you've provided it with a username and password in the account.txt file it will log in for you and run through the missions assigning vehicles. It will do so indefinitely.

~~This will not work for anyone else as it stands, but it only takes a small tweek to the vehicle checkbox code. You'll have to change the find by id to the id of your vehicle checkboxes. 
This is something i'll be changing soon.~~
